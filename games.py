class State:
    '''
    State class for the sliding tile puzzle: Needed by TreeSearch class to "understand" the
    current state of the puzzle and to generate new states by applying moves to the current state.

    Required arguments:
    - size: the size of the puzzle
    Optional
    - grid: the current state of the puzzle
    - parent: the previous state of the puzzle
    - action: the move that was taken to get to the current state
    - path_cost: the cost of the path from the initial state to the current state

    attributes:
    - size: the size of the puzzle
    - grid: the current state of the puzzle
    - emptyRow: the row of the empty tile
    - emptyCol: the column of the empty tile
    - path_cost: the cost of the path from the initial state to the current state
    - parent: the previous state of the puzzle
    - action: the move that was taken to get to the current state
    - heuristic: the estimated cost of the path from the current state to the goal state
    - eval: the evaluation function for A* and IDA*

    methods:
    - findEmpty: finds the empty tile in the grid
    - __hash__: hashes the grid as a tuple of tuples
    - __eq__: checks if two states are equal
    - __lt__: checks if the evaluation function of the current state is less than the evaluation function of another state
    - __gt__: checks if the evaluation function of the current state is greater than the evaluation function of another state
    - calc_heuristic: calculates the heuristic of the current state
    - goal_test: checks if the current state is the goal state
    - perform_action: performs a move on the current state
    - generate_legal_successors: generates all possible moves from the current state

    NOTE: These methods are required by the TreeSearch class, but they can be modified to suit the needs of the game.
    To use the TreeSearch class with a different game, you will need to implement a similar State class with the same methods for your game.
